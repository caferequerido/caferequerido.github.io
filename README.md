Github pages play ground.

### Things to try
- play around with getting structured responses from openai, https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/
    - Example : respond with 
        - person-name
        - year of birth
        - short description of person


- Make it more modular to work around the 2000 character discord limit 
- or refactor it to make it fit
- make it pretty
