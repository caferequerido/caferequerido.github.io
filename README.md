Github pages play ground.


### Things to fix
- the name of the file being published to github site is no longer available b/c we are generating multiple files with different names


### Things to try
- play around with getting structured responses from openai, https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/
    - Example : respond with 
        - person-name
        - year of birth
        - short description of person
- Gemini https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/
- https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/model-tuning

- Make it more modular to work around the 2000 character discord limit 
- or refactor it to make it fit
- make it pretty
